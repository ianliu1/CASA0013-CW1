### 1. Who collected the data?

A data activist called Murray Cox.
---

### 2. Why did they collect it?

He collected it to raise public and government awareness of the long-term impact Airbnb has on affordable housing and infrastructure[1]. The self comments shown in file are likely to be better than the reality in oder to be rented.
---

### 3. How was it collected?

It was collected by letting hosts filling out online forms and store in excel format. The whole process is completed by hosts themselves with little or no oversight from Airbnb. Thus the description may be untrue and the content may be exaggerated.
---

### 4. What useful information does it contain?

The dataset contains the latitude and longitude of the listing places for which one can apply geographical analysis by using geopandas.
The dataset also process information on self written descriptions about the listings. these descriptions often contain the distance the listings located from nearby public transportation stations or local shops/supermarkets, as well as facilities such as post offices.
One can compare the textual data with the actual distance calculated from geolocations.
Another useful piece of information is the amenities the listings have collected as textual data. One could use this data to find patterns.

### 5. To what extent is the data 'complete'?

The answer depends on what sort of analysis one wish to perform on this set of data. To perform spatial analysis on these Airbnb listings one would need the latitude and longitude information, which is a complete picture with only a few data entry missing randomly.
Also there are data entry missing with listings amenity description, but is covered in text so one could still use them to conduct further analysis.
However there are structurally missing data as well. The most obvious one is the hosts self description. Even if all the data is entered for this set, one could not simply use it as it is self written with no oversight or fact check what so ever. Information such as crime history are missing from the description and it could fundamentally change the perspective of the customers when come to choose their hosts.
Thus, it is not a complete picture and far from ideal. Missing data like this seriously pervent us from examine the data.

### 6. What kinds of analysis would this support?

Given the discussion above, there are a few analysis this data support. The first analysis we can perform is the geographical analysis.By using the latitude and longitude of the listing places, one can use the package called geopandas to perform spatial analysis.
Further to that, the self written descriptions about the listings could also be used, alongside with the geolocations of listings, for us to check whether the textual data is correct. I.E., one could calculate the distance the listings are from certain public transpotation stations or local facilities, and compare the distance obtained with the distance described in text.
Another kind of analysis one could conduct is to identify relevent qualities certain listings process by previewing textual data with regular expressions[2].
By using the python function regexes we could achieve such analysis. One would first need to think of some expressions that would signal the quality we are looking for.
For example, if we were to find which listings are budget choice, we could first come up with words like: affordable, cost effective, money saver, money saving, etc.

### 7. Which of the uses presented in Q.6 are _ethical_?

#### 350 words; 35 points; Which of the uses presented in Q.6 are ethical?  Justify the ethics of these analyses with reference to examples drawn from both your earlier answers and to the literature. 35 points
There are five principles of data ethics for business profissonals[3]. The five principles are ownership, transparency, privacy, intention and outcome. The two principles that worth most attention are ownership and privacy.
As we know the data activist Murray Cox constructed the data. whether he obtained these information legally remains questionable as there are many sensitive information including the listings host names and their precise geolocations.
One shall check if Murray Cox received consent from these hosts as well as their information. Otherwise all analysis conducted based on this set of data will be deemed unethical.
Another important principle is privacy. According to business insights[3], "Another ethical responsibility that comes with handling data is ensuring data subjects’ privacy. Even if a customer gives your company consent to collect, store, and analyze their personally identifiable information (PII), that doesn’t mean they want it publicly available."
Here PII is any information linked to an individual's identity, which includes names and street address. Thus the spatial analysis conducted in Q6 should be unethical as it is in use of the geolocations provided in the dataset.
